## Overview

Before jumping into any complex software development, it's often a good idea to spend some time designing the system or feature you will be working on.  A design is easy and quick to change.  A software implementation on the other hand, is not.

There are many generic diagramming tools that can be used to design software such as [diagrams.net (formerly draw.io)](https://www.diagrams.net/), [Miro](https://miro.com/online-whiteboard/), or [Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/).  These generic tools do allow a lot of flexibility but end up costing you more time than you intended to align all boxes and arrows and to get the colour schemes *just right*.

An approach gaining in popularity is to use tooling that allows 'diagrams-as-code'. In this way you describe the diagram with code and the tooling takes care of the visual rendering.  The added advantage is you can source control your diagrams and audit changes overtime.  Two popular choices for this are *PlantUML* and *Mermaid*.

PlantUML is a Java based engine has been around for a long time and is battle tested.

Mermaid is a JavaScript based engine and is the new kid on the block.

So, which one is best?  Let's take a look!

## Setup

**PlantUML**

First up, you'll need the PlantUML extension.  There are a few out there, but this is the best one:

![PlantUML Extension](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-extension.png)

Next, you'll need to setup a server to render the images there are 3 ways to do this:

1. Use the public online PlantUML server.
2. Install Java and GraphViz
3. Use Docker (recommended)

Using the online PlantUML server is not ideal as all your data must go over the internet, plus it adds latency to your renders.  You can install Java and GraphViz, but it can be a little messy.

By far, the easiest version is to run the [PlantUML docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/plantuml/plantuml-server/).  If you have docker desktop, this is easy to start up any time you need to render diagrams.  By using docker we keep our local machine clean.

**Mermaid**

Mermaid is easier to setup. The only extension you really need is the markdown render. The extension I use is:

![Mermaid Preview](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-preview-extension.png)

It's also useful to use the syntax highlighter to visually distinguish between different elements of your diagram.  For that we can use:

![Mermaid Syntax Highlighting](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-syntax-highlighting-extension.png)

## Diagrams

Both tools provide a set of different diagram types. Let's go through the most common diagrams along with a few special mentions.

### Activity / Flowcharts

Activities (PlantUML) or Flowcharts (Mermaid) are great for showing process flows have different branches of logic or loops.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startuml

start
:User Submits Order;
if (Check Warehouse Stock?) then (In Stock)
    if (Process Payment) then (Payment Success)
        if (Dispatch Order) then (Dispatch Success)
            :Show Success;
        else (Dispatch Failed)
            :Show Error;
        endif
    else (Payment Failed)
        :Show Error;
    endif
else (No Stock)
    :Show Error;
endif

stop

@enduml
```

![PlantUML Activity Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-activity.png)

**Mermaid**

```mermaid
flowchart TB
   Start --> USO;
   USO(User Submits Order) --> CWS;
   CWS(Check Warehouse Stock) -->|In Stock| PP
   CWS -->|No Stock| SE
   SE(Show Error) --> Finished
   PP(Process Payment) -->|Payment Success| DO
   PP -->|Payment Failed| SE
   DO(Dispatch Order) --> |Dispatch Success| SS
   DO -->|Dispatch Failed| SE
   SS(Show Success) --> Finished   
```

![Mermaid Flowchart](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-flowchart.png)

### Sequence Diagram

Sequence diagrams are not as good as Flowcharts for showing branches or loops (although it can be done), but they shine to show actions taken by different participants and the timing of the action execution.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startuml

title Sequence Diagram

autonumber

actor Customer as C
participant "Web Server" as WS
participant "Warehouse" as WH
participant "Stripe" as S

C -> WS: Submit Order
activate WS
WS -> WH: Check Stock
WS -> S: Process Payment
WS -> WH: Dispatch Order
WS -> C: Show Success
deactivate WS

@enduml
```

![PlantUML Sequence Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-sequence.png)

**Mermaid**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor C as Customer
    participant WS as Web Server
    participant WH as Warehouse
    participant S as Stripe

    C->>WS: Submit Order
    activate WS
    WS->>WH: Check Stock
    WS->>S: Process Payment
    WS->>WH: Dispatch Order
    WS->>C: Show Success
    deactivate WS
```

![Mermaid Sequence Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-sequence.png)

### Entity Relationship Diagram

ER diagrams can be useful to model entities and their relationships between each other. This can simply be the entity names or can also include attributes and their types.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startuml

title Entity Relationship Diagram

CUSTOMER ||--|| ORDER : places
ORDER ||--|{ LINEITEM : contains
CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERYADDRESS : uses

@enduml
```

![PlantUML ER Simple](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-er-simple.png)

```plantuml
@startuml

title Entity Relationship Diagram

entity CUSTOMER {
    string name
    string custNumber
    string sector
}

entity ORDER {
    int orderNumber
    string deliveryAddress
}
entity LINEITEM {
    string productCode
    int quantity
    float pricePerUnit
}

CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places

ORDER ||--|{ LINEITEM : contains

@enduml
```

![PlantUML ER Advanced](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-er-advanced.png)

**Mermaid**

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--|| ORDER : places
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    CUSTOMER }|..|{ DELIVERY-ADDRESS : uses
```

![Mermaid ER Simple](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-er-simple.png)

```mermaid
erDiagram
    CUSTOMER ||--o{ ORDER : places
    CUSTOMER {
        string name
        string custNumber
        string sector
    }
    ORDER ||--|{ LINE-ITEM : contains
    ORDER {
        int orderNumber
        string deliveryAddress
    }
    LINE-ITEM {
        string productCode
        int quantity
        float pricePerUnit
    }
```

![Mermaid ER Advanced](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-er-advanced.png)

### State Diagram

State diagrams are somewhat similar to flowcharts.  However, where flowcharts are better to show steps and branches, State diagrams are better to show valid transitions for a single value.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startuml

title State Diagram

    state "Todo" as TODO
    state "In Progress" as IP
    state "Code Review" as CR
    state "Deployed" as DEP
    state "In Test" as TST
    state "Done" as D
    
    [*] --> TODO
    TODO --> IP: started
    IP --> CR: in review
    CR --> IP: review done
    IP --> DEP: ready for deploy
    DEP --> TST: deployed
    TST --> IP: test failed
    TST --> D: test passed
    D --> [*]

@enduml
```

![PlantUML State Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-state.png)

**Mermaid**

```mermaid
stateDiagram
    state "Todo" as TODO
    state "In Progress" as IP
    state "Code Review" as CR
    state "Deployed" as DEP
    state "In Test" as TST
    state "Done" as D
    
    [*] --> TODO
    TODO --> IP: started
    IP --> CR: in review
    CR --> IP: review done
    IP --> DEP: ready for deploy
    DEP --> TST: deployed
    TST --> IP: test failed
    TST --> D: test passed
    D --> [*]
```

![Mermaid State Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-state.png)

### C4 Models
[C4 Models](https://c4model.com/) are great for showing the architecture of software from a high-level then zooming in to parts of the system for more detail.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startuml

!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml-stdlib/C4-PlantUML/master/C4_Context.puml
!include https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plantuml/plantuml-stdlib/master/logos/react.puml

'SHOW_PERSON_PORTRAIT()

title PlantUML C4 Context Diagram

Person(customer, "Customer", "Online Customer")
System(eCommerce, "E-Commerce", "E-Commerce System", $sprite="react")
System_Ext(stripe, "Stripe", "Payments")
System_Ext(warehouse, "Warehouse", "Stock inventory and dispatch")

Rel(customer, eCommerce, "orders products", "HTTPS")
Rel(eCommerce, stripe, "process payment", "HTTPS")
Rel(eCommerce, warehouse, "check stock", "HTTPS")

@enduml
```

![PlantUML C4 Context Diagram](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-c4-context.png)

**Mermaid**

Mermaid support for C4 is experiemental.  This is evident from the sub-standard diagram below. ðŸ˜¢

```mermaid
C4Context
    title C4 Context Diagram

    Person(customer, "Customer", "Online Customer")
    System(eCommerce, "E-Commerce", "E-Commerce System")
    System_Ext(stripe, "Stripe", "Payments")
    System_Ext(warehouse, "Warehouse", "Stock inventory and dispatch")

    Rel_D(customer, eCommerce, "orders products", "HTTPS")
    Rel_L(eCommerce, stripe, "process payment", "HTTPS")
    Rel_D(eCommerce, warehouse, "check stock", "HTTPS")
```

![Mermaid C4 Context](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-c4-context.png)

### GitGraph

GitGraph is kind of niche but could come in handy when documenting branching strategies.

**PlantUML**

Not supported.

**Mermaid**

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch feature/123
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature/123
    commit
```

![Mermaid GitGraph](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/mermaid-git-graph.png)

### JSON Data

JSON Data could come in handy when trying to visualize complex JSON structures.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startjson

title JSON Diagram

{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith",
  "isAlive": true,
  "age": 27,
  "address": {
    "streetAddress": "21 2nd Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY",
    "postalCode": "10021-3100"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "office",
      "number": "646 555-4567"
    },
        {
      "type": "mobile",
      "number": "0444 123-456"
    }
  ],
  "children": [],
  "spouse": null
}
@endjson
```

![PlantUML JSON Data](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-jsonDiagram.png)

**Mermaid**

Not supported.

### MindMap

MindMap is another niche diagram that you may never need, but nice to know it's available.

**PlantUML**

```plantuml
@startmindmap

title Mind Map
+ OS
++ Ubuntu
+++ Linux Mint
+++ Kubuntu
+++ Lubuntu
+++ KDE Neon
++ LMDE
++ SolydXK
++ SteamOS
++ Raspbian
-- Windows 95
-- Windows 98
-- Windows NT
--- Windows 8
--- Windows 10
@endmindmap
```

![PlantUML MindMap](/static/images/plantuml-vs-mermaid/plantuml-mind-map.png)

**Mermaid**

Not supported.

## Comparison

Overall, both tools do an excellent job, although in some cases one will shine over the other.

In terms of setup, Mermaid is the simplest as you don't need to set up any external applications or servers. **Winner: Mermaid**.

For Sequence diagrams, both syntax is similar, and the rendered image is also similar. **Winner: Draw**

For ER diagrams, again syntax is similar, but Mermaid renders the images slightly better. **Winner: Mermaid**

For State diagrams, syntax is also similar, but Mermaid renders the images slightly better. Not sure why PlantUML needs to have a line in the middle of each node. **Winner: Mermaid**

For C4 Models, Mermaid support is still experimental. This shows as you have little control over the way the diagram is rendered, and some parts are unreadable (i.e., arrows over nodes). PlantUML works as you would expect and has support for more advanced setup like sprites. Not even close on this one. **Winner: PlantUML**

GitGraph is not supported by PlantUML.  **Winner: Mermaid**

JSON Data is not supported by Mermaid.  **Winner: PlantUML**

MindMap is not supported by Mermaid.  **Winner: PlantUML**

In terms of customisation, PlantUML has been around far longer and supports advanced diagram customisation. Mermaids support is more limited. **Winner: PlantUML.**

The big elephant in the room is the rendering. Having markdown auto render the images in source control systems like Azure DevOps or GitHub is HUGE! This guarantees the diagrams will always be up to date with their definitions. With PlantUML, you need to also check in the images to source control and these could easily become out of date. **Winner: Mermaid**

Overall if I had to pick one, I would choose Mermaid.  The main reason being ease of use directly in markdown.  Mermaid will be fine for most of your needs, but for anything more complex or for doing C4 models, I would fall back to PlantUML. **Overall Winner: Mermaid**

## Summary

In this article we've explored how to setup PlantUML and Mermaid and the main differences between the two.  We've compared the common diagram types such as activity/flowcharts, sequence, entity relationship, state, and C4 models.  We also explored some niche diagrams such as gitgraph, JSON data, and mind maps.

Much of the syntax is similar between the two, but Mermaid tends to do a slightly better job at rendering a nicer looking diagram OOTB. Mermaids' big downfall is the experimental support for C4 models, which is an excellent for architectural diagrams.

As mentioned above Mermaid is the winner IMHO and performs best for most scenarios.  PlantUML is still a great tool and can be used as a fallback where Mermaid falls short.

Hope you've enjoyed exploring the difference between these two tools.  If you a favourite you prefer over both these, please let me know in the comments below.
