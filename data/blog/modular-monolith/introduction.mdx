## Introduction

When starting a new project, one of the first and most important decisions you'll have to make is choosing a Software Architecture. Choose an architecture that is too simple and the project will quickly outgrow it. Choose an architecture that is too complex and you'll spend more time maintaining the architecture than building the project.  Therefore, it's important to choose an architecture that is "just right".

## Architecture Comparison

Before we dive into Modular Monoliths, let's take a look at some of the other common architectures for context.

### Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, making your system easier to maintain and scale. This architecture is designed to keep the business logic independent of the frameworks and tools, which helps in achieving a decoupled and testable codebase.

### Vertical Slice Architecture

Vertical Slice Architecture structures your system around features rather than technical layers. Each feature is implemented end-to-end, including UI/API, business logic, and data access. This approach improves maintainability and reduces the risk of breaking changes.

This modular approach to software development can introduce inexperienced teams to the idea of shipping features as functional units with no shared knowledge of the domain entities, infrastructure layer, or application layer within another subsystem, further preparing them for future develeopment environments that may use Modular Monolith or Microservices Architecture.

### Microservices

Microservices architecture involves splitting the application into small, independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. This approach is beneficial for complex and large-scale applications with multiple teams working on different parts.

## What is a Modular Monolith?

A Modular Monolith organizes the system into modules that encapsulate specific functionalities. While it runs as a single application, it retains some benefits of microservices, such as independent module development and testing. Itâ€™s a good middle-ground between a monolith and microservices.

Within a Modular Monolith Architecture, each module could be implemented using Clean Architecture or Vertical Slice Architecture. Similarly, a Microservices Architecture could use Clean Architecture or Vertical Slice Architecture within each service.

Also, from a pragmatic point of view a combination of Modular Monolith and Microservices might provide the best of both worlds. The majority of the system could be implemented as a Modular Monolith, with a few key services implemented as Microservices to provide scalability and flexibility where needed.
